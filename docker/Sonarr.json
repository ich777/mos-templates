  "description": "Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The container will check on every start/restart if there is a newer version available (you can also choose between stabel and nightly version - keep in mind that switching from a stable to a nightly version and vice versa can break the container).\r\n\r\nMANUAL VERSION: You can also set a version manually by typing in the version number that you want to use for example: '2.0.0.5250' (without quotes) - you can also change it to 'latest' or 'nightly' like described above.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: Don't change the port in the Sonarr config itself.\r\n\r\nMIGRATION: If you are migrating from another Container please be sure to deltete the files/folders 'logs', 'xdg' and 'config.xml', don't forget to change the root folder for your tv shows and select 'No, I'll Move the Files Myself'!\r\n\r\nWARNING: The main configuration of the paths has a performance and disk usage impact: slow, I/O intensive moves and wasted disk space.
